                                    membrane of Gram-negative bacteria are known to disrupt the outer membrane and
                                    increase permeability. The increased permeability can increase the susceptibility of
                                    Gram-negative bacteria to other antibiotics. The best studied of this type of

                                    molecular &quot;sieves&quot; which restrict access of antibiotics and host defense
                                    molecules to their targets within the bacterial cell. Thus, cations and polycations
                                    which interact with and break down the outer membrane permeability barrier are
                                    capable of increasing the susceptibility of Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria to
                                    antibiotics and host defense molecules. Hancock and Wong demonstrated that a broad
                                    range of peptides could overcome the permeability barrier and coined the name &quot;permeabilizers&quot;
                                    to describe them (Hancock and Wong, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 26:48, 1984).

                                    agents by binding to the outer cellular membrane of bacteria. The interaction
                                    between the steroid derivatives and the bacteria membrane disrupts the integrity of
                                    the cellular membrane and results in the death of the bacteria cell. In addition,
                                    compounds of the present invention also act to sensitize bacteria to other
                                    antibiotics. At concentrations of the steroid derivatives below the corresponding
                                    minimum bacteriostatic concentration, the derivatives cause bacteria to become more
                                    susceptible to other antibiotics by increasing the permeability of the outer
                                    membrane of the bacteria. Measurements used to quantitate the effects of the steroid
                                    derivatives on bacteria include: measurement of minimum inhibitory concentrations
                                    (MICs), measurement of minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) and the ability of
                                    the steroid derivatives to lower the MICs of other antibiotics, e.g., erythromycin
                                    and novobiocin.

                                    provide the anti-microbial effect, in which case the amount of the compound
                                    administered is sufficient to be anti-microbial. Alternatively, an additional

                                    antibiotic) is included in the anti-microbial composition. By facilitating delivery
                                    to the target cells, the compounds can enhance the effectiveness of the additional

                                    FICs can be performed by checkerboard titrations of compounds in one dimension of a

                                    vice versa. An FIC of one indicates that the influence of the compounds is additive
                                    and an FIC of less than one indicates synergy. Preferably, an FIC of less than 0.5
                                    is obtained for synergism. As used herein, FIC can be determined as follows:

                                    of the compound is defined as the amount of the compound which, upon administration
                                    to a patient, inhibits growth of bacteria, kills bacteria cells, sensitizes bacteria
                                    to other antibiotics, or eliminates the bacterial infection entirely in the treated
                                    patient. The dosage of the composition will depend on the condition being treated,

                                    for oral administration to humans, a dosage of 0.01 to 100 mg/kg/day, preferably
                                    0.01-1 mg/kg/day, is generally sufficient. Effective doses will also vary, as

                                    reduce by at least 50%, and more preferably sufficient to reduce by 90%, a

                                    determined by one skilled in the art. The dosage can be adjusted by the individual
                                    physician in the event of any contraindications. In any event, the effectiveness of
                                    treatment can be determined by monitoring the level of LPS and TNF in a patient. A

                                    under N2 for 16 hours. Water formed during the reaction was removed by a Dean-Stark
                                    moisture trap. The cooled mixture was washed with NaHCO3 solution (50 mL) and
                                    extracted with Et2O (50 mL, 2*30 mL). The combined extracts were washed with brine

                                    heptapeptide containing a D amino acid and four diaminobutyric acid (DAB) residues.
                                    One of the DAB side chains is involved in forming the macrocylic ring, leaving the
                                    other three side chains with free amines. Thus, PMB has an array of amines oriented
                                    on one face, or plane, of a hydrophobic scaffolding. It has been suggested that the
                                    primary role of the macrocylic ring is to orient the amine groups in a specific

                                    compared to the compound with a hydroxyl group at C-24 (compare 2, 9 and 10, Tables
                                    1, 2, 6 and 7). Short chains of carbon or oxygen attached at C-20 decrease the MIC
                                    values of the cholic acid derivatives (compare 10 and 11, Tables 1 and 2).
                                    Covalently linking the cholic acid derivatives increases the activity of the

                                    permeabilization occurs as a result of association with the lipid A on the outer

                                    bacteria. For example, the differences among the MIC and MBC values for 106, 10, and

                                    Nearly all of the compounds demonstrated FIC values of less than 0.5, with some less
                                    than 0.03. The cholic acid derivatives that give relatively high FIC values (i.e.,
                                    5, 133, and 134) are themselves potent antibiotics.

                                    membrane of Gram-negative bacteria are known to disrupt the outer membrane and
                                    increase permeability. The increased permeability can increase the susceptibility of
                                    Gram-negative bacteria to other antibiotics. The best studied of this type of

                                    molecular &quot;sieves&quot; which restrict access of antibiotics and host defense
                                    molecules to their targets within the bacterial cell. Thus, cations and polycations
                                    which interact with and break down the outer membrane permeability barrier are
                                    capable of increasing the susceptibility of Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria to
                                    antibiotics and host defense molecules. Hancock and Wong demonstrated that a broad
                                    range of peptides could overcome the permeability barrier and coined the name &quot;permeabilizers&quot;
                                    to describe them (Hancock and Wong, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 26:48, 1984).

                                    derivatives on bacteria include: measurement of minimum inhibitory concentrations

                                    of compounds of formula I are described. The cellular membrane permeability is also
                                    measured and described. Compounds that are useful in accordance with the invention,
                                    as described below, include novel steroid derivatives that exhibit bacteriostatic,
                                    bactericidal, and bacterial sensitizer properties. Those skilled in the art will

                                    in the claims below, having the described characteristics. These characteristics can
                                    be determined for each test compound using the assays detailed below and elsewhere
                                    in the literature.

                                    steroid backbone, e.g., cholic acid. Other ring systems can also be used, e.g., 5
                                    member fused rings. Compounds with backbones having a combination of 5- and
                                    6-membered rings are also included in the invention. The amine or guanidine groups
                                    are separated from the backbone by at least one atom, and preferably are separated
                                    by at least two, three, or four atoms. The backbone can be used to orient the amine

                                    of the compound alone is determined.

                                    compounds of the invention, or the compounds in combination with known antibiotics.
                                    FICs can be performed by checkerboard titrations of compounds in one dimension of a
                                    microtiter plate, and of antibiotics in the other dimension, for example. The FIC is
                                    calculated by looking at the impact of one antibiotic on the MIC of the other and
                                    vice versa. An FIC of one indicates that the influence of the compounds is additive
                                    and an FIC of less than one indicates synergy. Preferably, an FIC of less than 0.5
                                    is obtained for synergism. As used herein, FIC can be determined as follows:

                                    effects of the compound with other compounds. For example, substances that generally
                                    may not be sufficiently effective against certain bacteria at safe dosages can be
                                    made more effective with the compound of the invention, thus enabling use of the
                                    substances against new categories of infections. Specifically, many existing
                                    antibiotics are effective against some Gram-positive bacteria, but are not currently
                                    indicated to treat Gram-negative bacterial infection. In some cases, the antibiotic
                                    may be ineffective by itself against Gram-negative bacteria because it fails to
                                    enter the cell. Compounds of the invention may increase permeability so as to render
                                    the antibiotics effective against Gram-negative bacteria.

                                    also useful for determination of synergy between compounds of the invention in
                                    combination with other compounds having unknown anti-bacterial activity or in
                                    combination with other compounds, e.g., compounds which have been tested and show
                                    anti-bacterial activity. For example, compounds of the invention may increase

                                    against bacteria. The FIC can also be used to test for other types of previously

                                    to a patient, inhibits growth of bacteria, kills bacteria cells, sensitizes bacteria

                                    bactericidal properties. PMB has a hydrophobic acyl group and a macrocylic
                                    heptapeptide containing a D amino acid and four diaminobutyric acid (DAB) residues.
                                    One of the DAB side chains is involved in forming the macrocylic ring, leaving the
                                    other three side chains with free amines. Thus, PMB has an array of amines oriented
                                    on one face, or plane, of a hydrophobic scaffolding. It has been suggested that the
                                    primary role of the macrocylic ring is to orient the amine groups in a specific
                                    arrangement necessary for binding the lipid A portion of LPS. The relative spatial

                                    membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (as shown in FIG. 3). Outer membrane
                                    permeabilization occurs as a result of association with the lipid A on the outer

                                    Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993, vol. 90, 1354-1358). It is proposed that squalamine
                                    incorporates into lipid bilayers and thus disrupts the bacterial membrane. In
                                    squalamine, the polar polyamine functionality is located at the distal end of the
                                    molecule, leaving a hydrophobic core. In 1, 2, 5, 106, 10, 112, 133, and 134, the
                                    amines are located on one side of the steroid, giving compounds that are facially
                                    amphiphilic. An additional series of compounds related to 1, 2, 5, 106, 10, 112,
                                    133, and 134 includes cholic acid derivatives with amines at C-24 (e.g., 140 in FIG.
                                    7). In contrast to 1, 2, 5, 106, 10, 112, 133, and 134, these compounds have been
                                    shown to have only weak antibacterial activity against Gram-positive strains and no
                                    activity against Gram-negative strains.

                                    to novel steroid derivatives and processes and intermediates for the preparation of
                                    these compounds.<lb/>Some compounds that associate strongly with the outer membrane
                                    of Gram- negative bacteria are known to disrupt the outer membrane and increase
                                    permeability. The increased permeability can increase the susceptibility of
                                    Gram-negative bacteria to other antibiotics. The best studied of this type of
                                    compound are the polymyxin antibiotics. For an example of a study involving the
                                    binding of polymyxin B to the primary constituent of the outer membrane of
                                    Gram-negative bacteria (lipid A) see: D. C. Morrison and D. M.<lb/>Jacobs, Binding

                                    Immunochemistry 1976, vol. 13, 813-819. For an example of a study involving the
                                    binding of a polymyxin derivative to Gram-negative bacteria see: M. Vaara and P.
                                    <lb/>Viljanen, Binding of Polymyxin B Nonapeptide to Gram-negative Bacteria,
                                    Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 1985, vol. 27, 548-554.<lb/>Membranes of
                                    Gram-negative bacteria are semipermeable molecular &quot;sieves&quot; which restrict
                                    access of antibiotics and host defense molecules to their targets within the
                                    bacterial cell. Thus, cations and poly cations which interact with and break down
                                    the outer membrane permeability barrier are capable of increasing the susceptibility
                                    of Gram- negative pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics and host defense molecules.
                                    Hancock and Wong demonstrated that a broad range of peptides could overcome the
                                    permeability barrier and coined the name &quot;permeabilizers&quot; to describe them
                                    (Hancock and Wong, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 26:48, 1984).<lb/>WO 00/42058

                                    groups are well-known to those in the art. In general, the species of protecting
                                    group is not critical, provided that it is stable to the conditions of any
                                    subsequent reaction(s) on other positions of the compound and can be removed at the
                                    appropriate point without adversely affecting the remainder of the molecule. In
                                    addition, a protecting group may be substituted for another after substantive
                                    synthetic transformations are complete. Clearly, where a compound differs from a
                                    compound disclosed herein only in that one or more protecting groups of the
                                    disclosed compound has been substituted with a different protecting group, that
                                    compound is within the invention. Further examples and conditions are found in T.W.

                                    bound to any particular theory, the steroid derivatives described herein act as
                                    bacteriostatic and bactericidal agents by binding to the outer cellular membrane of
                                    bacteria. The interaction between the steroid derivatives and the bacteria membrane
                                    disrupts the integrity of the cellular membrane and results in the death of the
                                    bacteria cell. In addition, compounds of the present invention also act to sensitize
                                    bacteria to other antibiotics. At concentrations of the steroid derivatives below
                                    the corresponding minimum bacteriostatic concentration, the derivatives cause
                                    bacteria to become more susceptible to other antibiotics by increasing the
                                    permeability of the outer membrane of the bacteria. Measurements used to quantitate
                                    the effects of the steroid derivatives on bacteria include: measurement of minimum
                                    inhibitory concentrations WO 00/42058 PCT/US00/01314 (MICs), measurement of minimum
                                    bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) and the ability of the steroid derivatives to
                                    lower the MICs of other antibiotics, e.g., erythromycin and novobiocin.<lb/>A person
                                    of skill will recognize that the compounds described herein preserve certain
                                    stereochemical and electronic characteristics found in steroids. The term &quot;same
                                    configuration&quot; as used herein refers to substituents on the fused steroid
                                    having the same stereochemical orientation. For example substituents R3, R7 and R12
                                    are all P-substituted or a-substituted. The configuration of the moieties R3, R7,
                                    and R12 substituted on C3, C7, and C12 may be important for interaction with the
                                    cellular membrane.<lb/>In another aspect, the invention features several methods of
                                    using the above- described compounds. For example, an effective amount of an
                                    anti-microbial composition comprising such a compound is administered to a host
                                    (including a human host) to treat a microbial infection. The compound by itself may
                                    provide the anti-microbial effect, in which case the amount of the compound
                                    administered is sufficient to be anti-microbial.<lb/>Alternatively, an additional
                                    anti-microbial substance to be delivered to the microbial cells (e.g., an
                                    antibiotic) is included in the anti-microbial composition. By facilitating delivery
                                    to the target cells, the compounds can enhance the effectiveness of the additional
                                    antimicrobial substance. In some cases the enhancement may be substantial.
                                    Particularly important target microbes are bacteria (e.g., Gram-negative bacteria
                                    generally or bacteria which have a substantial (&gt;40%) amount of a lipid A or
                                    lipid A-like substance in the outer membrane). Other microbes including fungi,
                                    viruses, and yeast may also be the target organisms.<lb/>The compounds can also be
                                    administered in other contexts to enhance cell permeability to introduce any of a
                                    large number of different kinds of substances into a cell, particularly the
                                    bacterial cells discussed above. In addition to introducing anti-microbial
                                    substances, the invention may be used to introduce other substances such as
                                    macromolecules (e.g., vector-less DNA).<lb/>The invention can also be used to make
                                    anti-microbial compositions (e.g., disinfectants, antiseptics, antibiotics etc.)
                                    which comprise one of the above compounds.<lb/>These compositions are not limited to
                                    pharmaceuticals, and they may be used topically or in non-therapeutic contexts to
                                    control microbial (particularly bacterial) growth. For example, they may be used in
                                    applications that kill or control microbes on contact.<lb/>In yet another aspect,
                                    the invention generally features methods of identifying compounds that are effective
                                    against a microbe by administering a candidate compound WO 00/42058 PCT/US00/01314
                                    and a compound according to the invention the microbe and determining whether the
                                    candidate compound has a static or toxic effect (e.g, an antiseptic, germicidal,
                                    disinfectant, or antibiotic effect) on the microbe. Again, bacteria such as those
                                    discussed above are preferred. This aspect of the invention permits useful testing
                                    of an extremely broad range of candidate anti-microbials which are known to have
                                    anti-microbial effect in some contexts, but which have not yet been shown to have
                                    any effect against certain classes of microbes such as the bacteria discussed above.
                                    As described in greater detail below, this aspect of the invention permits testing
                                    of a broad range of antibiotics currently thought to be ineffective against
                                    Gram-negative or lipid A-like containing bacteria.<lb/>In yet another aspect the
                                    invention features compositions which include one of the above compounds in
                                    combination with a substance to be introduced into a cell such as an antimicrobial
                                    substance as described in greater detail above. The compound and the additional
                                    substance may be mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<lb/>Other
                                    features or advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following
                                    detailed description of several embodiments, and also from the appending claims.

                                    general, the present invention provides the compounds of formula I described above.
                                    The preparation methods and the MIC and MBC of compounds of formula I are described.
                                    The cellular membrane permeability is also measured and described.<lb/>Compounds
                                    that are useful in accordance with the invention, as described below, include novel
                                    steroid derivatives that exhibit bacteriostatic, bactericidal, and bacterial
                                    sensitizer properties. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention
                                    extends to other compounds within the formulae given in the claims below, having the
                                    described characteristics. These characteristics can be determined for each test
                                    compound using the assays detailed below and elsewhere in the literature.<lb/>Known
                                    compounds that are used in accordance with the invention and precursors to novel
                                    compounds according to the invention can be purchased, e.g., from Sigma Chemical
                                    Co., St. Louis; Aldrich, Milwaukee; Steroids and Research Plus. Other compounds
                                    according to the invention can be synthesized according to known methods and the
                                    methods described below using publicly available precursors.<lb/>The compounds of
                                    the present invention include but are not limited to compounds having amine or
                                    guanidine groups covalently tethered to a steroid backbone, e.g., cholic acid. Other
                                    ring systems can also be used, e.g., 5 member fused rings. Compounds with backbones
                                    having a combination of 5- and 6-membered rings are also included in the invention.
                                    The amine or guanidine groups are separated from the backbone by at least one atom,
                                    and preferably are separated by at least two, three, or four atoms. The backbone can
                                    be used to orient the amine or guanidine groups on one face, or plane, of the
                                    steroid. For example, a scheme showing a compound having primary amino groups on one
                                    face, or plane, of a backbone is shown below:<lb/>NHz NH2 The biological activity of
                                    the compounds can be determined by standard methods known to those of skill in the
                                    art, such as the &quot;minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)&quot; assay described
                                    in the present examples, whereby the lowest concentration at which no change in
                                    optical density (OD) is observed for a given period of time is recorded as MIC.<lb/>
                                    WO 00/42058 PCT/US00/01314 When the compound alone is tested against a control that
                                    lacks the compound, the antimicrobial effect of the compound alone is determined.
                                    <lb/>Alternatively, &quot;fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC)&quot; is also
                                    useful for determination of synergy between the compounds of the invention, or the
                                    compounds in combination with known antibiotics. FICs can be performed by
                                    checkerboard titrations of compounds in one dimension of a microtiter plate, and of
                                    antibiotics in the other dimension, for example. The FIC is calculated by looking at
                                    the impact of one antibiotic on the MIC of the other and vice versa. An FIC of one
                                    indicates that the influence of the compounds is additive and an FIC of less than
                                    one indicates synergy. Preferably, an FIC of less than 0.5 is obtained for
                                    synergism. As used herein, FIC can be determined as follows:<lb/>MIC (compound in

                                    (antibiotic alone) This procedure permits determination of synergistic effects of
                                    the compound with other compounds. For example, substances that generally may not be
                                    sufficiently effective against certain bacteria at safe dosages can be made more
                                    effective with the compound of the invention, thus enabling use of the substances
                                    against new categories of infections.<lb/>Specifically, many existing antibiotics
                                    are effective against some Gram- positive bacteria, but are not currently indicated
                                    to treat Gram-negative bacterial infection. In some cases, the antibiotic may be
                                    ineffective by itself against Gram- negative bacteria because it fails to enter the
                                    cell. Compounds of the invention may increase permeability so as to render the
                                    antibiotics effective against Gram-negative bacteria.<lb/>In addition, fractional
                                    inhibitory concentration is also useful for determination of synergy between
                                    compounds of the invention in combination with other compounds having unknown
                                    anti-bacterial activity or in combination with other compounds, e.g., compounds
                                    which have been tested and show anti-bacterial activity. For example, compounds of
                                    the invention may increase permeability so as to render compounds lacking
                                    anti-bacterial activity effective against bacteria. The FIC can also be used to test
                                    for other types of previously unappreciated activity of substances that will be
                                    introduced into the cell by means of permeability enhancing compounds according to
                                    the invention.<lb/>While we do not wish to be bound to any single specific theory,
                                    and such a theory is not necessary to practice the invention, one mechanism of
                                    action is the lipid A interaction of multiple (usually three) moieties, which under
                                    physiological conditions are positively charged, e.g., guanidino or amino moieties.
                                    The moieties extend away from the WO 00/42058 PCT/US00/01314 general plane of the
                                    remainder of the molecule, thus mimicking certain aspects of the structure of
                                    polymyxins. In this regard, compounds of the invention will generally be useful in
                                    the way that polymyxins are useful. For example, polymyxin B (PMB) and polymyxin B
                                    nonapeptide (PMBN) are useful for permeabilizing bacterial membranes.<lb/>Moreover,
                                    in regard to systemic administration, those skilled in the art will recognize
                                    appropriate toxicity screens that permit selection of compounds that are not toxic
                                    at dosages that enhance microbial permeability.<lb/>As noted, the invention also
                                    involves topical as well as non-therapeutic (antiseptic, germicidal, or
                                    disinfecting) applications in which the compounds are contacted with surfaces to be
                                    treated. The term &quot;contacting&quot; preferably refers to exposing the bacteria
                                    to the compound so that the compound can effectively inhibit, kill, or lyse
                                    bacteria, bind endotoxin (LPS), or permeabilize GramDnegative bacterial outer
                                    membranes. Contacting may be in vitro, for example by adding the compound to a
                                    bacterial culture to test for susceptibility of the bacteria to the compound.
                                    Contacting may be in vivo, for example administering the compound to a subject with
                                    a bacterial disorder, such as septic shock.<lb/>&quot;Inhibiting&quot; or &quot;inhibiting
                                    effective amount&quot; refers to the amount of compound which is required to cause a
                                    bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect. Examples of bacteria which may be inhibited
                                    include E. coli, P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, S. typhimurium, M. tuberculosis and S.
                                    aureus. In addition, the compounds of the invention can be used to inhibit
                                    antibiotic-resistant strains of microorganisms.<lb/>The method of inhibiting the
                                    growth of bacteria may further include the addition of antibiotics for combination
                                    or synergistic therapy. The appropriate antibiotic administered will typically
                                    depend on the susceptibility of the bacteria such as whether the bacteria is
                                    Gram-negative or Gram-positive, and will be easily discernable by one of skill in
                                    the art.<lb/>Examples of particular classes of antibiotics to be tested for
                                    synergistic therapy with the compounds of the invention (as described above) include
                                    aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin), penicillins (e.g., piperacillin), cephalosporins
                                    (e.g., ceftazidime), fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin), carbepenems (e.g.,
                                    imipenem), tetracyclines and macrolides (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin). The
                                    method of inhibiting the growth of bacteria may further include the addition of
                                    antibiotics for combination or synergistic therapy. The appropriate antibiotic
                                    administered will typically depend on the susceptibility of the bacteria such as
                                    whether the bacteria is Gram-negative or Gram- positive, and will be easily
                                    discernable by one of skill in the art. Further to the antibiotics listed above,
                                    typical antibiotics include aminoglycosides (amikacin, gentamicin, WO 00/42058

                                    classes of antibiotics include carbapenems (e.g., imipenem), monobactams
                                    (e.g.,aztreonani), quinolones (e.g., fleroxacin, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin,
                                    ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, lomefloxacin and cinoxacin), tetracyclines
                                    (e.g., doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline), and glycopeptides (e.g., vancomycin,
                                    teicoplanin), for example. Other antibiotics include chloramphenicol, clindamycin,

                                    polymyxins, such as PMB.<lb/>Administration The compounds may be administered to any
                                    host, including a human or non- human animal, in an amount effective to inhibit not
                                    only growth of a bacterium, but also a virus or fungus. These compounds are useful
                                    as antimicrobial agents, antiviral agents, and antifungal agents. The compounds may
                                    be administered to any host, including a human or non-human animal, in an amount
                                    effective to inhibit not only growth of a bacterium, but also a virus or fungus.
                                    These compounds are useful as antimicrobial agents, antiviral agents, and antifungal
                                    agents.<lb/>The compounds of the invention can be administered parenterally by
                                    injection or by gradual infusion over time. The compounds can be administered

                                    Preparations for parenteral administration of a compound of the invention include
                                    sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Examples of
                                    non- aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such
                                    as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers
                                    include water, WO 00/42058 PCT/US00/01314 alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or
                                    suspensions, including saline and buffered media. Patenterai vehicles include sodium
                                    chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated
                                    Ringer's, or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient

                                    like.<lb/>The invention provides a method of treating or ameliorating an endotoxemia
                                    or septic shock (sepsis) associated disorder, or one or more of the symptoms of
                                    sepsis comprising administering to a subject displaying symptoms of sepsis or at
                                    risk for developing sepsis, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the
                                    invention. The term &quot;ameliorate&quot; refers to a decrease or lessening of the
                                    symptoms of the disorder being treated. Such symptoms which may be ameliorated
                                    include those associated with a transient increase in the blood level of TNF, such
                                    as fever, hypotension, neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, disseminated

                                    organ failure. Patients who require such treatment include those at risk for or
                                    those suffering from toxemia, such as endotoxemia resulting from a Gram-negative
                                    bacterial infection, venom poisoning, or hepatic failure, for example. In addition,
                                    patients having a Gram-positive bacterial, viral or fungal infection may display
                                    symptoms of sepsis and may benefit from such a therapeutic method as described
                                    herein. Those patients who are more particularly able to benefit from the method of
                                    the invention are those suffering from infection by E. coli, Haemophilus influenza
                                    B, Neisseria meningitidis, staphylococci, or pneumococci. Patients at risk for
                                    sepsis include those suffering from gunshot wounds, renal or hepatic failure,
                                    trauma, bums, immunocompromised (HIV), hematopoietic neoplasias, multiple myeloma,
                                    Castleman's disease or cardiac myxoma.<lb/>In addition, the compounds may be
                                    incorporated into biodegradable polymers allowing for sustained release, the
                                    polymers being implanted in the vicinity of where delivery is desired, for example,
                                    at the site of an bacterial infection. The biodegradable polymers and their use are
                                    described in detail in Brem et al., J. Neurosurg, 74:441-446 (1991).<lb/>As
                                    mentioned above, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation having
                                    an effective amount of a compound of formula I for treating a patient having a
                                    bacterial infection. As used herein, an effective amount of the compound is defined
                                    as the amount of the compound which, upon administration to a patient, inhibits
                                    growth of WO 00/42058 PCT/US00/01314 bacteria, kills bacteria cells, sensitizes
                                    bacteria to other antibiotics, or eliminates the bacterial infection entirely in the
                                    treated patient. The dosage of the composition will depend on the condition being
                                    treated, the particular derivative used, and other clinical factors such as weight
                                    and condition of the patient and the route of administration of the compound.
                                    However, for oral administration to humans, a dosage of 0.01 to 100 mg/kg/day,
                                    preferably 0.01-1 mg/kg/day, is generally sufficient. Effective doses will also
                                    vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art, dependent on route of
                                    administration, excipient usage, and the possibility of co-usage with other
                                    therapeutic treatments including other antibiotic agents.<lb/>For example, the term
                                    &quot;therapeutically effective amount&quot; as used herein for treatment of
                                    endotoxemia refers to the amount of compound used is of sufficient quantity to
                                    decrease the subject's response to LPS and decrease the symptoms of sepsis. The term
                                    &quot;therapeutically effective&quot; therefore includes that the amount of compound
                                    sufficient to prevent, and preferably reduce by at least 50%, and more preferably
                                    sufficient to reduce by 90%, a clinically significant increase in the plasma level
                                    of TNF. The dosage ranges for the administration of compound are those large enough
                                    to produce the desired effect.<lb/>Generally, the dosage will vary with the age,
                                    condition, sex, and extent of the infection with bacteria or other agent as
                                    described above, in the patient and can be determined by one skilled in the art. The
                                    dosage can be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any
                                    contraindications. In any event, the effectiveness of treatment can be determined by
                                    monitoring the level of LPS and TNF in a patient. A decrease in serum LPS and TNF
                                    levels should correlate with recovery of the patient.<lb/>In addition, patients at
                                    risk for or exhibiting the symptoms of sepsis can be treated by the method as
                                    described above, further comprising administering, substantially simultaneously with
                                    the therapeutic administration of compound, an inhibitor of TNF, an antibiotic, or
                                    both. For example, intervention in the role of TNF in sepsis, either directly or
                                    indirectly, such as by use of an anti-TNF antibody and/or a TNF antagonist, can
                                    prevent or ameliorate the symptoms of sepsis. Particularly preferred is the use of
                                    an anti-TNF antibody as an active ingredient, such as a monoclonal antibody with TNF
                                    specificity as described by Tracey, et al. (Nature, 330:662,1987).<lb/>A patient who
                                    exhibits the symptoms of sepsis may be treated with an antibiotic in addition to the
                                    treatment with compound. Typical antibiotics include an aminoglycoside, such as
                                    gentamicin or a beta-lactam such as penicillin, or cephalosporin or any of the
                                    antibiotics as previously listed above. Therefore, a preferred therapeutic method of
                                    the WO 00/42058 PCT/US00/01314 invention includes administering a therapeutically
                                    effective amount of cationic compound substantially simultaneously with
                                    administration of a bactericidal amount of an antibiotic.<lb/>Preferably,
                                    administration of compound occurs within about 48 hours and preferably within about
                                    2-8 hours, and most preferably, substantially concurrently with administration of
                                    the antibiotic.<lb/>The term &quot;bactericidal amount&quot; as used herein refers
                                    to an amount sufficient to achieve a bacteria-killing blood concentration in the
                                    patient receiving the treatment. The bactericidal amount of antibiotic generally
                                    recognized as safe for administration to a human is well known in the art, and as is
                                    known in the art, varies with the specific antibiotic and the type of bacterial
                                    infection being treated.<lb/>Because of the antibiotic, antimicrobial, and antiviral
                                    properties of the compounds, they may also be used as preservatives or sterillants
                                    of materials susceptible to microbial or viral contamination. The compounds of the
                                    invention can be utilized as broad spectrum antimicrobial agents directed toward
                                    various specific applications. Such applications include use of the compounds as
                                    preservatives in processed foods when verified as effective against organisms
                                    including Salmonella, Yersinia, Shigella, either alone or in combination with
                                    antibacterial food additives such as lysozymes; as a topical agent (Pseudomonas,
                                    Streptococcus) and to kill odor producing microbes (Micrococci). The relative
                                    effectiveness of the compounds of the invention for the applications described can
                                    be readily determined by one of skill in the art by determining the sensitivity of
                                    any organism to one of the compounds.<lb/>While primarily targeted at classical
                                    Gram-negative-staining bacteria whose outer capsule contains a substantial amount of
                                    lipid A, it may also be effective against other organisms with a hydrophobic outer
                                    capsule. For example, Mycobacterium spp. have a waxy protective outer coating, and
                                    compounds of the invention in combination with antibiotics may provide enhanced
                                    effectiveness against Mycobacterial infection, including tuberculosis. In that case,
                                    the compounds could be administered nasally (aspiration), by any of several known
                                    techniques.<lb/>Apart from anti-microbial action, the permeability provided by the
                                    compounds may enhance introduction of a great variety of substances into microbes.
                                    For example, the compounds may be used to enhance introduction of macromolecules
                                    such as DNA or RNA into microbes, particularly Gram-negative bacteria. In that case,
                                    there may be no need for the traditional vectors (e.g., phages) used to package
                                    nucleic acids when transfecting the microbes. Conditions and techniques for
                                    introducing such WO 00/42058 PCT/US00/01314 macromolecules into microbes using the
                                    compounds of the invention will in most cases be routine.<lb/>The formulations
                                    include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and
                                    sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular,
                                    intravenous, intradermal, intraocular, intratracheal, and epidural) administration.
                                    The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be
                                    prepared by conventional pharmaceutical techniques. Such techniques include the step
                                    of bringing into association the active ingredient and the pharmaceutical carrier(s)
                                    or excipient(s). In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and
                                    intimately bringing into associate the active ingredient with liquid carriers or
                                    finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.
                                    <lb/>Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be
                                    presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a
                                    predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a
                                    solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an
                                    oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil emulsion and as a bolus, etc.<lb/>A
                                    tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory
                                    ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable
                                    machine, the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules,
                                    optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative,
                                    surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding, in a
                                    suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid
                                    diluent. The tablets may optionally coated or scored and may be formulated so as to
                                    provide a slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein.<lb/>
                                    Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges
                                    comprising the ingredients in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or
                                    tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as
                                    gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the
                                    ingredient to be administered in a suitable liquid carrier.<lb/>Formulations
                                    suitable for topical administration to the skin may be presented as ointments,
                                    creams, gels and pastes comprising the ingredient to be administered in a
                                    pharmaceutical acceptable carrier. A preferred topical delivery system is a
                                    transdermal patch containing the ingredient to be administered.<lb/>WO 00/42058
                                    PCT/US00/01314 Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a
                                    suppository with a suitable base comprising, for example, cocoa butter or a
                                    salicylate.<lb/>Formulations suitable for nasal administration, wherein the carrier
                                    is a solid, include a coarse powder having a particle size, for example, in the
                                    range of 20 to 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is
                                    taken, i.e., by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the
                                    powder held close up to the nose. Suitable formulations, wherein the carrier is a
                                    liquid, for administration, as for example, a nasal spray or as nasal drops, include
                                    aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient.<lb/>Formulations suitable for
                                    vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes,
                                    foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such as
                                    carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<lb/>Formulations suitable for
                                    parenteral administration include aqueous and non- aqueous sterile injection
                                    solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, other bacteriostats and solutes
                                    which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and
                                    aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and
                                    thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose
                                    containers, for example, sealed ampules and vials, and may be stored in a
                                    freeze-dried (lyophilized) conditions requiring only the addition of the sterile
                                    liquid carrier, for example, water for injections, immediately prior to use.
                                    Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile
                                    powders, granules and tables of the kind previously described.<lb/>Preferred unit
                                    dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit, daily sub-dose, as
                                    herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the administered
                                    ingredient.<lb/>It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients,
                                    particularly mentioned above, the formulations of this invention may include other
                                    agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question,
                                    for example, those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents.

                                    the sense of being compatible with the active ingredient of the formulation (and
                                    preferably, capable of stabilizing it) and not deleterious to the subject to be
                                    treated.<lb/>Without further elaboration, it is believed that the above description
                                    has adequately enabled the present invention. The following specific embodiments
                                    are, therefore, to be WO 00/42058 PCT/US00/01314 construed as merely illustrative,

                                    membrane permeabilization and bactericidal properties.<lb/>PMB has a hydrophobic
                                    acyl group and a macrocylic heptapeptide containing a D amino acid and four
                                    diaminobutyric acid (DAB) residues. One of the DAB side chains is involved in
                                    forming the macrocylic ring, leaving the other three side chains with free amines.
                                    Thus, PMB has an array of amines oriented on one face, or plane, of a hydrophobic
                                    scaffolding. It has been suggested that the primary role of the macrocylic ring is
                                    to orient the amine groups in a specific arrangement necessary for binding the lipid
                                    A portion of LPS. The relative spatial orientation of these primary amine groups is
                                    the same in the cholic acid derivatives as in PMB.<lb/>The stereochemistry of the
                                    steroid backbone results in different activities of the cholic acid derivatives
                                    (compare 2 and 8, Tables 1, 2, 6 and 7). Compounds with guanidine groups attached to
                                    the steroid have lower MIC values than compounds containing amine groups (compare 1,
                                    2, 4 and 5, compare Tables 1-8). The length of the tether between the amine or
                                    guanidine groups and the steroid backbone also influences activity (compare 1-3,
                                    Tables 1, 2, 6 and 7). Ester tethers between amine groups and the WO 00/42058
                                    PCT/US00/01314 steroid backbone provide compounds with MIC values that are higher
                                    than the corresponding compounds containing ether tethers (compare 1, 2, 6 and 7,
                                    Tables 1 and 2).<lb/>The group attached to the backbone at C-20 or C-24 also
                                    influences the activity of the cholic acid derivatives. A long carbon chain attached
                                    to the steroid via an ether linkage at C-24 lowers the MIC of the compound as
                                    compared to the compound with a hydroxyl group at C-24 (compare 2, 9 and 10, Tables
                                    1,2, 6 and 7). Short chains of carbon or oxygen attached at C-20 decrease the MIC
                                    values of the cholic acid derivatives (compare 10 and 11, Tables 1 and 2).
                                    Covalently linking the cholic acid derivatives increases the activity of the

                                    membrane Compounds 11, 106, and 108-114 (Fig. 1) were tested for antibiotic
                                    activity. They were also tested for the ability to permeabilize the outer membrane
                                    of Gram-negative bacteria, causing sensitization to hydrophobic antibiotics that
                                    cannot cross the outer membrane. The permeabilization of the outer membrane was
                                    measured using erythromycin and novobiocin. These antibiotics are active against
                                    Gram-positive bacteria, but inactive against Gram-negative bacteria, due to the
                                    barrier formed by the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.<lb/>Most of the
                                    experiments were performed with Escherichia coli K-12 strain ATCC 10798; however, to
                                    demonstrate that the activity of the cholic acid derivatives was not species
                                    dependent, the activity of selected compounds was also measured with Pseudomonas
                                    aeruginosa (ATCC 27853). The MICs of erythromycin and novobiocin against E. coli
                                    (ATCC 10798) at 70 and &gt;500 fxg/mL were measured. The threshold measure of
                                    permeabilization was the concentration of the cholic acid derivatives required to
                                    lower the MIC of either erythromycin or novobiocin to 1 p.g/mL.<lb/>Results of the
                                    MIC, MBC and permeabilization (with erythromycin) measurements are shown in Fig. 2
                                    (in Fig. 2, Compound A is polymyxin B nonapeptide). As Fig. 2 illustrates, the MIC
                                    and MBC values of the compounds dropped dramatically as the length of the side chain
                                    extending from C-17 increased. The apparent role of the hydrophobic steroid side
                                    chain is to facilitate membrane insertion and self-promoted transport after initial
                                    association with the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (as shown in Fig.<lb/>
                                    3). Outer membrane permeabilization occurs as a result of association with the lipid
                                    A on the outer leaflet of the membrane. Permeabilization of the outer membrane alone
                                    does not cause cell death, suggesting that the compounds must pass through the outer
                                    membrane to WO 00/42058 PCT/US00/01314 kill bacteria. This ability to traverse the
                                    outer membrane, and thereby disrupt the cytoplasmic membrane, is required for the
                                    compounds to have lethal activity.<lb/>As observed, compounds lacking a hydrophobic
                                    side chain are less effective in killing bacteria. It is hypothesized that these
                                    compounds are capable of permeabilizing the outer membrane (i.e., associating with
                                    the lipid A on the outer leaflet of the membrane), but incapable of crossing through
                                    the outer membrane.<lb/>The fractional inhibition concentration (FIC) values of the
                                    compounds, were calculated using erythromycin and novobiocin as the secondary
                                    compounds. With the exception of 114, the compounds displayed FIC values of less
                                    than 0.5 with erythromycin, with some values near 0.05 (Table 9).<lb/>Details from
                                    studies with novobiocin are also shown in Table 9. The fact that results with
                                    erythromycin and novobiocin were comparable demonstrates that the activity of the
                                    cholic acid derivatives is not antibiotic-dependent. Similar trends were observed
                                    with E. coli (ATCC 10798) and P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), although, as expected, P.
                                    <lb/>aeruginosa was more resistant than E. coli. These results suggest that the
                                    activity of the compounds tested is not species-dependent.<lb/>Compounds with
                                    hydrophobic alkylaminoalkyl side chains were prepared (compounds 133 and 134, Fig.
                                    4). As observed with other compounds, the incorporation of guanidine groups (in 134)
                                    increased the activity of the cholic acid derivatives as compared to compounds
                                    containing primary amines. As a control, 135 (Fig. 4), which did not have a
                                    hydrophobic side chain, was prepared. The MIC of the control (135) was relatively
                                    high, as expected, as was the MBC (Fig. 5). In contrast, the MICs of 133 and 134
                                    were very low; in fact they rivaled PMB in activity. Notably, the MBCs of 133,134,
                                    and PMB were very similar to the MICs; that is, at a threshold concentration these
                                    compounds killed all of the bacteria in solution.<lb/>As an additional means of
                                    demonstrating the membrane disrupting capabilities of the cholic acid derivatives
                                    133 and 134, a luciferin/luciferase-based cell lysis assay was used (as described in
                                    Willardson et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998, 64, 1006 and Schupp et al.,
                                    Biotechniques 1995, 19, 18). In this assay, E. coli containing an inducible
                                    luciferase coding plasmid was incubated with the inducing agent (toluene), then
                                    treated with a lysis buffer containing either PMB or one of the cholic acid
                                    derivatives, and Triton X-100. Luciferin and ATP were then added. Cell lysis
                                    resulted in luminescence. The concentrations of the membrane disrupting agents (PMB
                                    and the cholic acid derivatives) WO 00/42058 PCT/US00/01314 were varied, and the
                                    resulting luminescence was measured. In the absence of the membrane disrupting
                                    agents, no luminescence was observed.<lb/>The MICs of 133, 134 and PMB and the
                                    concentrations required for half maximal luminescence are shown in Fig. 6. As is the
                                    case with the MIC values, the compounds 133 and 134 rival PMB in activity in the
                                    luminescence assay.<lb/>Effect of sulfate group To observe if the presence of a
                                    sulfate group at C-24 in a cholic acid derivative would increase the activity of the
                                    compounds, 132 (shown in Fig. 7) was tested. The MIC of 132 with E. coli (ATCC
                                    10798) was 60 |ig/mL. The concentration required to lower the MIC of erythromycin to
                                    1 jj,g/mL was 4.0 (ig/mL with the same strain. The antibiotic and permeabilization
                                    activities of 132 were lower than those of the parent alcohol 110 (shown in Fig. 1).
                                    <lb/>Additional experiments Additional experiments were carried out using compounds
                                    1,2, 5,106,10,112, 133, and 134. MIC and MBC data for these compounds with
                                    representative strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms are shown in
                                    Table 10. For comparison purposes, the MICs of PMB with various organisms were also
                                    measured and are presented in Table 10.<lb/>In addition to PMB, compounds 1,2, 5,
                                    106, 10, 112, 133, and 134 share some features with other steroid antibiotics. For
                                    example, squalamine includes a steroid nucleus and a polyamine side chain (Moore et
                                    al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993, vol. 90, 1354- 1358). It is proposed that
                                    squalamine incorporates into lipid bilayers and thus disrupts the bacterial
                                    membrane. In squalamine, the polar polyamine functionality is located at the distal
                                    end of the molecule, leaving a hydrophobic core. In 1, 2, 5,106, 10, 112,133, and
                                    134, the amines are located on one side of the steroid, giving compounds that are
                                    facially amphiphilic. An additional series of compounds related to 1, 2, 5,106, 10,
                                    112, 133, and 134 includes cholic acid derivatives with amines at C-24 (e.g., 140 in
                                    Fig. 7). In contrast to 1, 2, 5,106,10,112, 133, and 134, these compounds have been
                                    shown to have only weak antibacterial activity against Gram-positive strains and no
                                    activity against Gram- negative strains.<lb/>The cholic acid derivatives 1, 2, 5,
                                    106, 10, 112, 133, and 134 display a range of activities, some with submicrogram per
                                    milliliter MICs. With many organisms, MIC and MBC values are very similar,
                                    especially with the most active compounds. Some of the WO 00/42058 PCT/US00/01314
                                    compounds have lethal activity, presumably due to disraption of the cytoplasmic
                                    membrane. Others have only sublethal activity, due to permeabilization of the outer
                                    membrane.<lb/>Compounds lacking a hydrophobic chain (e.g., 106 and 10) have high MIC
                                    values, but are effective permeabilizers of the outer membrane of Gram-negative
                                    bacteria.<lb/>Because these compounds lack a hydrophobic chain, they have sublethal,
                                    but not lethal activity against these bacteria. Compounds with hydrophobic chains
                                    (e.g., 133 and 134) have lethal activity.<lb/>The hemolytic behavior of the cholic
                                    acid derivatives 1, 2, 5, 106, 10, 112, 133, and 134 suggests that they can act as
                                    membrane-disrupting agents, and their antimicrobial activity likely involves
                                    membrane disruption. With Gram-negative strains, the target of inactivity is
                                    expected to be the cytoplasmic membrane. Compounds such as 106 and ineffectively
                                    cross the outer membrane and do not display lethal activity. The hydrophobic chains
                                    in 133 and 134 may facilitate self-promoted transport across the outer membrane,
                                    allowing them to disrupt the cytoplasmic membrane.<lb/>The results shown in Table 10
                                    indicate that the presence of a hydrophobic chain is much less important for lethal
                                    activity against Gram-positive strains. Without the requirement for crossing an
                                    outer membrane, compounds lacking a hydrophobic chain extending from C-17 can
                                    effectively kill Gram-positive bacteria.<lb/>Various tether lengths were
                                    investigated to determine the optimal spacing of the amine or guanidine groups from
                                    the steroid. It was found that three carbon tethers gave compounds that were more
                                    effective than those with two carbon tethers (e.g., compare the MICs of 1 with those
                                    of 2. The resultant increase in antibiotic activity upon substitution of guanidine
                                    groups for amines suggests a central role for amine/guanidine-phosphate
                                    interactions.<lb/>The nature of the group attached to the steroid backbone at C-17
                                    greatly influenced the activity of the compounds with Gram-negative bacteria. For
                                    example, the differences among the MIC and MBC values for 106, 10, and 112 were
                                    notable. This trend was also observed in the MIC and MCB values of 2 and 5, as
                                    compared to those of 133 and 134 (in this comparison, the benzyl groups in 2 and 5
                                    are expected to be less hydrophobic than the octyl chains found in 133 and 134). The
                                    influence of the group attached to the steroid at C-17 is less pronounced with
                                    Gram-positive strains; e.g., 5 and 134 have similar MIC values with Staphylococcus
                                    aureus.<lb/>WO 00/42058 PCT/US00/01314 To measure permeabilization, the FIC values
                                    for compounds 1, 2, 5, 106, 10, 112, 133, and 134 with erythromycin, novobiocin, and
                                    rifampicin were determined.<lb/>Concentrations of 0.5, 1.0 or 3.0 jag/mL of these
                                    antibiotics were used, and the concentrations of the cholic acid derivatives
                                    required to inhibit bacterial growth of Gram- negative strains were determined. The
                                    concentrations required for bacterial growth inhibition and the FIC values are shown
                                    in Tables 11-13. Interestingly, the MIC values of the compounds do not directly
                                    correlate with their ability to permeabilize the outer membrane. For example,
                                    compounds 106 and 10 have relatively high MIC values, but are potent permeabilizers.
                                    Nearly all of the compounds demonstrated FIC values of less than 0.5, with some less
                                    than 0.03. The cholic acid derivatives that give relatively high FIC values (i.e.,
                                    5, 133, and 134) are themselves potent antibiotics.<lb/>Ester and amide side chains
                                    Additional compounds, for example, compounds with amide and ester side chains, were
                                    tested. Compounds 203b, 6, and 210a (Scheme 12) displayed potent synergism with
                                    erythromycin and novobiocin (Table 14). In the triester series (203 a, 203b, 6, and
                                    7), the p-alanine derived compounds are more active than those derived from glycine.
                                    <lb/>Substitution at C24 had minimal effect on the activity of these compounds
                                    (compare 203b and 7).<lb/>Triamides 209a-c (Scheme 12) were less active than the
                                    esters, possibly due to conformational constraints imposed by the amide bonds. With
                                    the triamides, substitution at C24 had significant effects on the activity of the
                                    compounds (compare 209a and 210a, Table 14). In this series, the glycine derivative
                                    was more active than the corresponding (3- alanine derivative.<lb/>The relative lack
                                    of synergism displayed by the lysine derivative may be attributable to the length of
                                    the side chain. As a control, compound 211 (Fig. 8), a derivative of 209c lacking
                                    the a-amino group, was prepared; this compound was less active than 209c as a
                                    permeabilizer. Compound 206 also proved to be ineffective as a permeabilizer. These
                                    results suggest that the optimal length for the tether between the steroid and the
                                    amine functionality is between zero and six atoms.<lb/>WO 00/42058 PCT/US00/01314

                                    molecular &quot;sieves&quot; which restrict access of antibiotics and host defense
                                    molecules to their targets within the bacterial cell. Thus, cations and polycations
                                    which interact with and break down the outer membrane permeability barrier are
                                    capable of increasing the susceptibility of Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria to
                                    antibiotics and host defense molecules. Hancock and Wong demonstrated that a broad
                                    range of peptides could overcome the permeability barrier and coined the name &quot;permeabilizers&quot;
                                    to describe them (Hancock and Wong, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 26:48, 1984).

                                    methods of using the above-described compounds. For example, an effective amount of
                                    an anti-microbial composition comprising such a compound is administered to a host
                                    (including a human host) to treat a microbial infection. The compound by itself may
                                    provide the anti-microbial effect, in which case the amount of the compound
                                    administered is sufficient to be anti-microbial. Alternatively, an additional

                                    antibiotic) is included in the anti-microbial composition. By facilitating delivery
                                    to the target cells, the compounds can enhance the effectiveness of the additional

                                    lipid A-like substance in the outer membrane). Other microbes including fungi,
                                    viruses, and yeast may also be the target organisms.

                                    FICs can be performed by checkerboard titrations of compounds in one dimension of a
                                    microtiter plate, and of antibiotics in the other dimension, for example. The FIC is
                                    calculated by looking at the impact of one antibiotic on the MIC of the other and
                                    vice versa. An FIC of one indicates that the influence of the compounds is additive
                                    and an FIC of less than one indicates synergy. Preferably, an FIC of less than 0.5
                                    is obtained for synergism. As used herein, FIC can be determined as follows:

                                    indicated to treat Gram-negative bacterial infection. In some cases, the antibiotic
                                    may be ineffective by itself against Gram-negative bacteria because it fails to

                                    heptapeptide containing a D amino acid and four diaminobutyric acid (DAB) residues.
                                    One of the DAB side chains is involved in forming the macrocylic ring, leaving the

                                    primary role of the macrocylic ring is to orient the amine groups in a specific
                                    arrangement necessary for binding the lipid A portion of LPS. The relative spatial

                                    membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (as shown in FIG. 3). Outer membrane
                                    permeabilization occurs as a result of association with the lipid A on the outer

                                    of Gramnegative bacteria are known to disrupt the outer membrane and increase
                                    permeability. The increased permeability can increase the susceptibility of
                                    Gram-negative bacteria to other antibiotics. The best studied of this type of

                                    by binding to the outer cellular membrane of bacteria. The interaction between the
                                    steroid derivatives and the bacteria membrane disrupts the integrity of the cellular
                                    membrane and results in the death of the bacteria cell. In addition, compounds of

                                    bacteriostatic concentration, the derivatives cause bacteria to become more
                                    susceptible to other antibiotics by increasing the permeability of the outer
                                    membrane of the bacteria. Measurements used to quantitate the effects of the steroid
                                    derivatives on bacteria include: measurement of minimum inhibitory concentrations
                                    (MICs), measurement of minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) and the ability of

                                    and novobiocin.

                                    antibiotics in the other dimension, for example. The FIC is calculated by looking at
                                    the impact of one antibiotic on the MIC of the other and vice versa. An FIC of one
                                    indicates that the influence of the compounds is additive and an FIC of less than
                                    one indicates synergy. Preferably, an FIC of less than 0.5 is obtained for
